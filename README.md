Hare is a user-friendly lib for sockets in Golang. You can send and listen to TCP connections with a few lines of code.

- [Examples](#examples)
- [Testing](#testing)

## Installation

First you need [Go](https://golang.org/) installed (version 1.12+ is required), then you can install Hare:

```shell
$ go get -u "github.com/leozz37/hare"
```

Import it in your code:

```shell
import "github.com/leozz37/hare"
```

(Optional) install [jaguar](https://github.com/leozz37/jaguar) for testing the sockets:

```shell
$ brew tap leozz37/jaguar

$ brew install jaguar
```

## Quick start

[Sample code](./examples/send.go) for sending payloads:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/leozz37/hare"
)

func main() {
    hare.Send(3000, "Hello, World")
}
```

[Sample code](./examples/listen.go) for listening a port:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/leozz37/hare"
)

func main() {
    r, _ := hare.Listen("3000")

    for {
        if r.HasNewMessages() {
            fmt.Println(r.GetMessage())
        }
    }
}
```

## Documentation

The library consists on two features: **listen** and **send** to a given port. You can check the full documentation on [Godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/leozz37/hare#section-documentation).

### Send

Receives a `port` and a `message`, both as `string` and returns an `error` (if something goes wrong).

```go
func Send(port, message string) error;
```

Usage example:

```go
func main() {
    err := hare.Send(3000, "Hello, World")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

---

### Listen

Receives a `port` as `string` and returns a `Listener` struct and an `error` (if something goes wrong).

```go
func Listen(port string) (*Listener, error);
```

Usage example:

```go
func main() {
    r, _ := hare.Listen("3000")
    l, _ := hare.listen("3001")

    for {
        if r.HasNewMessages() {
            fmt.Println(r.GetMessage())
        } else if l.HasNewMessages() {
            fmt.Println(l.GetMessage())
        }
    }
```

---

### Listener

The **Listener** struct returned by `Listen()` function has the following fields:

```go
type Listener struct {
    SocketListener net.Listener
    HasNewMessages func() bool
    GetMessage     func() string
    Stop           func()
}
```

`SocketListener` is the socket connection.

```go
listener.SocketListener, _ = net.Listen("tcp", "localhost:" + port)
```

`HasNewMessages()` function returns a `bool` being `true` with there's a new message:

```go
func main() {
    r, _ := hare.Listen("3000")

    if r.HasNewMessages() {
        fmt.Println("There's a new message!")
    }
}
```

`GetMessage()` function returns a `string` with the last message received on the socket:

```go
func main() {
    r, _ := hare.Listen("3000")

    if r.HasNewMessages() {
        fmt.Println(r.GetMessage())
    }
}
```

`Stop()` function closes the listener connection:

```go
func main() {
    r, _ := hare.Listen("3000")
    hare.Send("3000", "Hey beauty")

    r.Stop()

    err := Send("3000", "This should fails")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

## Examples

You can check the [example](./examples) for code usages, like [send](./examples/send.go) and [listen](./examples/listen.go) samples.

Since Hare only listen and send messages, here's a complete example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/leozz37/hare"
)

func listenSockets(port string) {
    r, _ := hare.Listen(port)

    for {
        if r.HasNewMessages() {
            fmt.Println(r.GetMessage())
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    go listenSockets("3000")
    go listenSockets("3001")

    for {
        hare.Send("3000", "Hello port 3000")
        hare.Send("3001", "Hello port 3001")
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
    }
}
```

## Testing

To run the test suite, you can run with:

```shell
$ go test
```

If you want a more detailed report with coverage and an `coverage.out` file, do the following:

```shell
$ go test -v -covermode=count -coverprofile=coverage.out
```

## Contributing

A full guideline about contributing to Alacritty can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

### Issues

Use the search tool before opening a new issue.

Please provide source code and commit sha if you found a bug.

Review existing issues and provide feedback or react to them.

### Pull requests

Open your pull request against ```develop```.

You should add/modify tests to cover your proposed code changes.

Tests coverage should never go down from 90%.

If your pull request contains a new feature, please document it on the README.

### Branching

The ```main``` is a **regular branch** which always contains the latest
**stable** codebase and must **never** be broken.

The ```develop``` is a **regular branch** which always contains the latest
**development** codebase and **eventually** can be broken. But you'll need to
accept the **sombrero of shame** if you do that.

The ```release``` is a **regular branch** which contains a specific release
version. You must use the following name convention: **release-X.Y.Z**, where
X, Y and Z are: major, minor and patch [version numbers](#versioning).

The ```experimental``` is a **temporary branch** which contains a new feature or
ideia. You must use the following name convention: **experimental-brief-description**.

The ```feature``` is a **temporary branch** which contains a new feature under
development that latr will be merged against the development branch. You must
use the following name convention: **feature-brief-description**.

The ```bugfix``` is a **temporary branch** which contains necessary fix to be
applied **after** a specific release to be merged against the development branch.
You must use the following name convention: **bugfix-brief-description**.

The ```hotfix``` is a **temporary branch** which contains a critical fix to be
applied **immediately** and merged against the main and the development branches.
You must use the following name convention: **hotfix-brief-description**.

Feel free to apply the labels from GitHub to the branches, they are very helpful.

### Versioning

The project uses the [semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org) in
order to control the version numbers.

### Commiting

The ```main```, ```develop``` and ```release``` branches have protection rules
against **push**.

In order to contribute you must create a new branch following the [branching](#branching)
guideline and once your work is done, open a **pull request** from your branch
to the **develop** branch.

The **pull request** will trigger the test suites automatically
and the code must **pass all the tests** and also be reviewed and approved
before merged in the **develop** branch (or even ``main`` or ``release`` in case
of a ``*fix``).

Feel free to apply the labels from GitHub to the pull requests, they are very helpful.
